## ðŸ’¬ Example Inputs

You can type queries like:

- `"I need a laptop for gaming under 30 million VND."`
- `"Iâ€™m a student looking for something light and long battery life."`
- `"What is a good machine for programming and portability?"`

## ðŸ“¦ Sample Laptop Data

The chatbot compares against a hardcoded database of 3 laptops:
- Asus TUF Gaming F15 (gaming, high performance)
