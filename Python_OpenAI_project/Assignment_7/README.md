# Hugging Face TTS Demo with Sentence Pausing

This project demonstrates how to generate human-like speech using the [facebook/fastspeech2-en-ljspeech](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fastspeech2-en-ljspeech) model from Hugging Face and Fairseq. It includes a feature to insert **2-second pauses between sentences** for more natural audio playback.
